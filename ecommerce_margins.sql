- SQL Database Querying Rank Function Window Function 

Suppose you're an analyst for an e-commerce store. Youâ€™re trying to identify the top selling items (by revenue) that have the highest margins. 

Using the tables below, can you write a SQL query that pulls the distributor, product_id, total revenue, total cost, total net margin, and number of units sold. Then, can you create additional columns that rank total net margin, total revenue, and total cost from greatest to least?

Table: orders

order_id	         integer	         unique order number
product_id	      integer	         id of product
